\title{K-means clustering using the Gaussian means approach}
\usage{
Gmeans(x, alpha = 1e-04, k = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame or matrix with each row representing an individual observation}

\item{alpha}{The significance level for the Gaussian tests for splitting}

\item{k}{Initial number of centers to begin with. Default is 1. The initial set of centers is generated using K-means}
}
\value{
A list containing the following elements:
   centers A C x ncol(x) matrix representing the C cluster centers
   numIterations A numeric value denoting the number of iterations
   clusters A vector representing the cluster number for each observation in x
}
